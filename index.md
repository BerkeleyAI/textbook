This is the textbook for the [CS 161: Computer Security course at UC
Berkeley](https://cs161.org/). It provides a brief survey over common topics in
computer security including memory safety, cryptography, web security, and
network security.

As it stands currently, this textbook is a work-in-progress based on course
notes compiled from past semesters, with active work being done to organize them
into a single reference for students to use. Please contact
[cs161-staff@berkeley.edu](mailto:cs161-staff@berkeley.edu) for information
regarding corrections.
