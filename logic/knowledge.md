# 10.1 A Knowledge Based Agent

Imagine a dangerous world filled with lava, the only respite a far away oasis. We would like our agent to be able to safely navigate from its current position to the oasis.

In reinforcement learning, we assume that the only guidance we can give is a reward function which will try to nudge the agent in the right direction, like a game of 'hot or cold'. As the agent explores and collects more observations about the world, it gradually learns to associate some actions with positive future reward and others with undesirable, scalding death. This way, it might learn to recognize certain cues from the world and act accordingly. For example, if it feels the air getting hot it should turn the other way.

However, we might consider an alternative strategy. Instead, let's tell the agent some facts about the world and allow it to reason about what to do based on the information at hand. If we told the agent that air gets hot and hazy around pits of lava, or crisp and clean around bodies of water, then it could reasonably infer what areas of the landscape are dangerous or safe based on its readings of the atmosphere. This alternative type of agent is known as a **knowledge-based agent**. Such an agent maintains a **knowledge base**, which is a collection of logical **sentences** that encode what we have told the agent and what it has observed. The agent is also able to perform **logical inference** to draw new conclusions.
