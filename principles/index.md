# Principles and Patterns

The security principles module of this course is the least technically involved
and is essentially covered in the first one or two lectures. Basically, it's a
list of "things to remember" when thinking about security. Vulnerabilities will
usually violate one or more of these rules. Your job on exams is to determine
which security principle best fits a given scenario.

We teach these security principles because they are prevalent across all avenues
of the security field and you may hear about them in academic literature, or
just in informal conversation in the class.
